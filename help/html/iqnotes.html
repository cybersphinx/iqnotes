<h2>Introduction</h2>
IQNotes is notes kept in a hierarchical manner. This is a simple and handy way
to keep data well organized. Each note can be tasked with percentage complete, 
priority or event with day, month, year and optionally time. IQNotes also provides 
advanced sorting. Each note can additionally be associated with entries like company, 
person, user account, credit card, WWW link ... and even a sketch.<br>

<h2>Menu</h2>
<a href="menufile"></a><h3>File</h3>
<dl>
<dt>New</dt>
  <dd>Create a new file.</dd>
<dt>Open</dt>
  <dd>Open a data file.</dd>
<dt>Save</dt>
  <dd>Save a data file.</dd>
<dt>Close</dt>

<a name="menutree"></a>
<h3>Tree</h3>
<dl>

<dt>Search</dt>
  <dd>Search the tree for a string. The results will be shown in a new tree, which 
    can then be closed. After closing, the current note in the search tree is 
    set as the current note in the tree.</dd>

<dt>Quick add</dt>
<dd>Will add a text note at the top of the tree, with the name 'Quick note'. Useful for fast adding.</dd>

<dt>Add before</dt>
  <dd>Add a new note before the selected note.</dd>

<dt>Add after</dt>
  <dd>Add a new note after the selected note.</dd>

<dt>Add child</dt>
  <dd>Add a new note as a child of the selected note.</dd>

<dt>Sort</dt>
  <dd>You can set the order priorities for each note type (task, event, ...), 
    define the show order (if the tasks are first event, second ...). You can 
    sort in the current level, in the current level and down, or the whole tree. 
    The settings in the sort dialog are remembered for the next use. </dd>

<dt>Expand tree</dt>
  <dd>Expand the whole tree.</dd>

<dt>Collapse tree</dt>
  <dd>Collapse the whole tree.</dd>

<dt>Task list</dt>
  <dd>Show tasks in a flat view. Tasks can be taken from the whole tree or from 
    the current note down. Tasks in this list can be sorted. When closing this 
    list, the current task in this list is selected as current in the notes tree.</dd>

<dt>Event list</dt>
<dd>Same as Task list, but for events</dd>

<dt>Reminder</dt>
  <dd>Show the reminder list</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Note</h3>
<dl>

<dt>Edit</dt>
<dd>Edit the selected note.</dd>

<dt>Cut</dt>
  <dd>Delete the selected note and store it in the clipboard. This function is useful for removing or moving a note and
    its subtree to another place. </dd>

<dt>Copy</dt>
  <dd>Copy only the current note or also it's whole subtree to the clipboard.</dd>

<dt>Paste</dt>
  <dd>Paste the note stored in the clipboard after/before/as a child of the current note.<br>
    This is a potentially dangerous action if you are moving 
    a note from <b>another</b> data file, if that file has a different definition 
    for its entries, with different properties than are in the current file. So 
    before moving from another data file, check the definition in the <i>Options</i> 
    menu to see if they are the same in <b>both</b> data files. If you had to 
    make changes to the entry to make it the same, make the changes, save and 
    close that data file, open it again, delete the note you wish to move, open 
    destination data file and add the last deleted note. Pretty confusing, isn't 
    it? ':)</dd>

<dt>Set picture</dt>
  <dd>Set the picture for the current note. See IQNotes homepage for additional nice pictures.
    If you want to add your own pictures,
    just load them to /home/QtPalmtop/iqnotes/items. The pic size _MUST_ be 16x16.</dd>

<dt>Set task</dt>
<dd>Set the task properties (percentage, priority) for the current note.</dd>

<dt>Set event</dt>
  <dd>Set the event properties (date and optionally time) for the current note.</dd>

<dt>Unset</dt>
<dd>Discard the task or event data of the current note.</dd>

<dt>Set reminder</dt>
  <dd>Set the reminder for the current note. Set the date when the item is shown 
    in the reminder list.</dd>

<dt>Unset reminder</dt>
  <dd>Discard the reminder associated with the current note.</dd>

<h3>Options</h3>
<dl>

<dt>Define new entry</dt>
  <dd>The note can be plain text, or a defined entry. You can define any kind 
    of entry, for example 'Pet'. You must define the properties, like 'Name', 
    'Color', 'Count of the legs', 'Personality', ... :). Notes added thereafter
    will prompt for the new data item.</dd>

<dt>Change entry</dt>
  <dd>If you want to change an entry, click here. Even the entry which is used 
    in notes can be changed.</dd>

<dt>Delete entry</dt>
  <dd>Delete an entry. Only entries which are not used by IQNotes can be deleted.</dd>

<dt>Preferences</dt>
<dd><b>Notes</b><br>
<i>Root node decoration</i><br>
    Select if the root node should have a plus sign (+), if it has children.<br>
<i>Word wrap</i><br>
    If word wrap is set, than text the widget is set to word wrap notes.<br>
<i>Show scrollbars</i><br>
   Show or hide a scrollbars.<br>
<i>Vertical layout</i><br>
   Use vertical or horizontal layout. Set the most suitable for you.<br>
<i>Choose default font</i><br>
<b>Backup</b><br>
    This option, if set, automatically saves a backup file in a chosen location 
    after IQNotes is closed. The location must be a directory, for example '/mnt/cf/backup/iqnotes'. 
    Currently, there is only a manual method to re-use a backup file. You have 
    to copy the backup file to the location ~/Applications/iqnotes/<br>
<b>Security</b><br>
    Here, you can set up encryption for the saved data file. The data is encrypted 
    by rijndael aka AES, which the USA government considers as secure and it replaced 
    the DES algorithm. If you haven't set up a password the first two options 
    (current, don't encrypt) will be disabled. With the next two options, you 
    can set up or change your password. For changing or turning encryption off, 
    you must supply the current password. The backup file is also stored encrypted. 
    <b>BEWARE</b>, there is no way to decrypt data if you forgot the password.

<dt>Sketches</dt>
  <dd>If is the sketch too big, you can move it in the half or hide tree view simply by tapping on it and moving the stylo to the desired direction.</dd>
<dt>View layout</dt>
  <dd>Are you using Zaurus C7xx model? Try to change layout in the Options / Preferences for better viewing.</dd>
